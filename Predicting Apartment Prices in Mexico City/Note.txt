> SimpleImputer: fills out missing/NaN values by central tendency
> OneHotEncoder: transpose a categorical column into a numerical identity matrix
> Ridge over Linear Regression:
    - over fitting issue due to the curse of dimentionality
    - LR tries to be as close as possible to the data points
    - favours a certain data point
    - can not generalise fitting higher no. of features
    - coeff becomes become unexpectively bigger or smaller
